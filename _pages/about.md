I am a Senior High Performance Compute Architect at NVIDIA, working on the cutting-edge research focused on the design of next-generation GPUs for Exascale Supercomputers. My role is rooted in the architecture group, where I mainly focus on accelerating various domains of scientific computing and state-of-the-art HPC+AI applications.

Short Bio
======
I received my Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, in 2013, and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Colorado State University in 2022, under the guidance of [Prof. Sudeep Pasricha](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/~sudeep). I have published in various peer-reviewed top-tier international conferences and journals and I have had the opportunity to present my research at a global stage. Additionally, I have authored a [research book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-28016-0), contributed to several book chapters, and hold the distinction of being an inventor on a U.S. patent.

My Journey
======
My research journey has fostered expertise across a broad spectrum of domains, particularly in the areas of deep learning and distributed system design, specializing in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and large-scale heterogeneous distributed high-performance computing (HPC) systems, alongside advanced network simulation methodologies.

My Ph.D. research at the Embedded, High Performance, and Intelligent Computing ([EPIC](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/~sudeep/wp-content/uploads/epic_lab_poster.pdf)) Laboratory focused on the design of next-generation automotive networks, security and fault-tolerance in cyber-physical systems, and machine learning. Moreover, during my Ph.D., I worked as research associate (2019-21) at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HP Labs) conducting research on exascale HPC systems, exascale networks, and next-generation high-radix switch designs. My contributions were pivotal to the HPE’s Pathforward project (funded by the U.S. Department of Energy) and other next-generation research projects, including those focused on Fabric Attached Memory (FAM).

Additionally, during the initial years of my Ph.D. and master’s journey at Colorado State University, I served as a lead ECE graduate student advisor for CSU EcoCAR3 program (2014-18), and the year 1 of the CSU EcoCAR Mobility Challenge (2018-19). I spearheaded pioneering research, focusing on control systems development and optimization, ADAS integration, and employing model-based system design and simulation methodologies for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Throughout this journey, I have had the invaluable opportunity to mentor over 75 students across various disciplines of engineering, encompassing the spectrum from freshman to senior years of undergraduate studies, as well as M.S. and Ph.D. candidates. I also had the opportunity to work as a research intern at the National Renewable Energy Labs (NREL), Golden, CO, in the summer of 2018.
