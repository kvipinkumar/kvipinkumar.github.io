### Abstract
This book provides comprehensive coverage of various solutions that address issues related to real-time performance, security, and robustness in emerging automotive platforms. The authors discuss recent advances towards the goal of enabling reliable, secure, and robust, time-critical automotive cyber-physical systems, using advanced optimization and machine learning techniques. The focus is on presenting state-of-the-art solutions to various challenges including real-time data scheduling, secure communication within and outside the vehicle, tolerance to faults, optimizing the use of resource-constrained automotive ECUs, intrusion detection, and developing robust perception and control techniques for increasingly autonomous vehicles.
