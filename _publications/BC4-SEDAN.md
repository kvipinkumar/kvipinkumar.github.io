### Abstract
The increasing number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and greater connectivity with external systems have made modern-day vehicles highly vulnerable to various cyber-attacks. Several security mechanisms have been developed to address this issue, but they incur high computational overhead on the ECUs, which can delay safety-critical task executions and message transfers. In this chapter, we introduce a methodology to derive security requirements for tasks and messages in automotive systems based on the ISO 26262 standard. We then propose a novel security framework called SEDAN, which increases the security of the system without violating the real-time constraints and security requirements of messages, or ECU utilization limits.
